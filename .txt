### 3. Opening Folder
    - Since I guess that over the boot sequence all of the requests are made. 
    - The names and location of all of the folders and files within the projects
        are already booted. 

### 4. Opening a couple files: 
    Notice how the same file has two endpoints it likes to use. 
    It uses the GET method to render the content very quickly in the screen
    THEN it uses the PATCH method in order to updates the contents of the file 

[30/May/2025 19:05:43] "GET /api/files/files/16/ HTTP/1.1" 200 293
[30/May/2025 19:05:45] "PATCH /api/files/files/16/ HTTP/1.1" 200 293
[30/May/2025 19:05:46] "GET /api/files/files/15/ HTTP/1.1" 200 273
[30/May/2025 19:05:47] "PATCH /api/files/files/15/ HTTP/1.1" 200 273
[30/May/2025 19:05:47] "GET /api/files/files/12/ HTTP/1.1" 200 1079
[30/May/2025 19:05:48] "PATCH /api/files/files/12/ HTTP/1.1" 200 1079

### 5. Editing a file: 

    The behavior here is that everytime that I click on a part of the editor,
    The PATCH method is called. Clearly that is going to be an issue if we are
    going into production
